# game-unpack-tool
tools、unpack、extract、decompress
这是我自己收集的各种游戏的解包工具，按游戏引擎分，有unity游戏的、虚幻引擎游戏的、galgame游戏的，按平台分，有pc的、Android的、nds、3ds、wii、wiiu、Switch、ps1、ps2、ps3、ps4、xbox360……，，按游戏厂商分，有光荣特库摩、地雷社、万代南梦宫等，虽然我不会逆向，但我喜欢研究各种游戏文件，寻找这些游戏文件的规律，在解各种各样的游戏中收获非常大，因此我也在不断的学习和成长，开始主要是收集各种解包工具，后来我开始学会了用python脚本、制作python脚本，接着开始尝试把python 脚本制作成exe程序，或者用dnspy修改一些难用的c#的exe，把它们改成好用的exe程序，这些都可以帮助我们大大节省时间，为了防止解包工具失传，我决定上传到github上拿出来分享，希望能帮助到世界各地的朋友们。
This is a collection of unpacking tools for various games that I have collected myself. By game engine, there are Unity games, Unreal Engine games, Galgame games, and by platform, there are PC, Android, NDS, 3ds, Wii, Wii U, Switch, PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360... By game manufacturer, there are Koei Tecmo, compile heart, Bandai Namco, etc. Although I do not know how to reverse engineer, I enjoy studying various game files and finding patterns in them. I have gained a lot from solving various games, so I am constantly learning and growing. At the beginning, I mainly collected various unpacking tools. Later on, I began to learn how to use Python scripts and create Python scripts. Then, I began to try making Python scripts into exe programs, or using dnspy to modify some difficult C # exes, Transforming them into user-friendly exe programs can greatly save us time. In order to prevent the loss of unpacking tools, I have decided to upload them to GitHub and share them, hoping to help friends around the world.
